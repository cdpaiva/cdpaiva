### Hi there, I'm Carlos Paiva 👋

I'm a Chemical Engineer, currently studying System Analysis and Development at INFNET (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil - remote) and pursuing a career change into web development.
I love to learn about programming and share knowledge with others, my go-to place for that is [Exercism](https://exercism.org/profiles/cdpaiva) 
I'm interested in all parts of Full Stack Development, at the moment I'm diving into Front-end development.

If you have some time, do [check my blog](https://cdpaiva.github.io).
